# VintageSticks

VintageSticks is a simple content mod for Vintage Story that adds crafting recipes to create sticks directly from wood. Surprisingly, the base game lacks a straightforward method to craft this fundamental item, and this mod fills that gap with intuitive recipes.

## Features

- Adds multiple recipes to craft sticks from different wood types
- Balanced with existing gameplay mechanics
- Does not alter any other aspects of the game
